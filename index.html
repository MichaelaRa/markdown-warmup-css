It features a built-in system that allows you to install new packages or create a custom one yourself. Developers love Atom because it’s free, customizable and because it was created using web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js).

### 2. Brackets
Adobe’s Brackets text editor has been around since 2014. Like Atom, Brackets is a free open-source platform written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is used primarily for web development. Some of the features of Brackets include Inline Editors, which allow you zero-in on specific code rather than jumping between file tabs, and Live Preview, which shows you exactly what your code and changes will look like in a browser.
Brackets is the best web IDE if you are looking for an editor that understands web design. It comes with a great set of visual tools and preprocessor supports and it has been created by the web designers for the web designers. Another great thing about this web development IDE is the fact that it is open source and completely free of charge. In addition to that, it has a big and passionate community which is always there to help. Here are some of the Bracket’s useful and unique features:
Inline Editors: you can simply open a window into the code you care about most instead of jumping between file tabs.
Live Preview: allows you to get a real-time connection to your browser; whenever you make changes to HTML and CSS, you immediately see the changes on the screen
Preprocessor Support: allows you to use Quick Edit and Live Highlight with your LESS and SCSS files which will make working with them much easier than usually

### 3. Notepad++
Another open-source and free editor,Notepad++ is written in C++ and offers higher speed and a smaller overall program size. Notepad has a reputation for being “environmentally friendly” and even touts this benefit on its website, highlighting the fact that it uses less CPU power resulting in a greener environment. Developers like the fact that Notepad++ only takes up 4MB of space upon download. It also supports 50+ programming languages and even allows users to define their own.
Notepad++ is an opensource IDE and one of the top free IDEs written in C++. It supports over 50 languages and while it is not far from being the best IDE for Windows, you have to keep in mind that it is available for Windows only.

### 4. Sublime Text
Sublime Text is a fast and lightweight cross-platform code editor packed with features and plugins that developers love. With its “Goto Anything” keyboard shortcut, you can easily jump to any symbol or line of code within your program. The Multiple Selections option allows you to make several changes at one time rather than having to go correct each line of code individually. Built with a powerful Python API, Sublime Text welcomes several types of plugins and is completely customizable.

### 5. Vim
A free open-source software,Vim was first released way back in 1991. It is a cross-platform solution that continues to show up on favorite code editors lists decades later.

The software is completely customizable and offers extensive documentation and how-to guides for its users.

### 6.Visual Studio Code x2
Judging by the reader feedback, VS Code is a a pretty popular code editor. It works on Windows, Mac and Linux (both Debian/Ubuntu and Red Hat/Fedora/SUSE). Among the advantages are an active community and a rich extension gallery that can be called by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.

Light Table is a reactive work surface for the creation and exploration of apps or programs.

With Light Table, you can move things around, keep clutter down, bring information to the places you need it most etc. In addition to that, Light Table is a standalone app and you can run it just like any other editor you have been using so far. Here are the guiding principles of this cool web development IDE:

-    Editors can be anywhere and show you anything – not just text

-    We can shine some light on related bits of code

### 9. NetBeans

### 10.Komodo Edit
Komodo Edit is the free and Open-Source counterpart of Komodo IDE (paid software). It is a great JavaScript IDE free of charge with a bunch of new integrations that will allow you to get your favorite frameworks, languages, and tools in one cross-platform web development IDE.

Sublime is a top IDE and one of the best JavaScript editors available for free. It is currently available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is fast and flexible and it will do everything one should expect from the best IDE for website development.

### 12. IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ IDEA is a great web development IDE that offers several plans. There is a free community version but if you want to take advantage of all the Java Script development tools it has to offer, you should consider checking out the paid-for Ultimate Edition. It might actually be worth your while. IntelliJ IDEA is a great CSS IDE, but it also supports a wide variety of programming languages such as AngularJS, CoffeeScript, HTML, JS, LESS, Node JS, PHP, Python, Ruby, Sass, TypeScript, and more. The most important features include:
-    Extensive database editor and UML designer
-    Supports multiple build systems
-    Test runner UI

-    Intelligent text editors for HTML, CSS, and Java
-    Integrated version control
-    AIR Mobile supports Android and iOS devices
However, keep in mind that while it might be the best JS editor, IntelliJ comes with a pretty steep learning curve so it is probably not the best option for absolute beginners.

### 13. Webstorm
WebStorm IDE The leading IDE development company, JetBrains, targeted JavaScript with the WebStorm IDE. It is an extremely user-friendly and lightweight IDE that was designed with the aim of creating a state of the art web apps. For that reason, it supports technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but also Angular JS, TypeScript, Node.js, Meteor, ECMAScript, React, Vue.js, Cordova, and others. It is the best IDE for modern JavaScript development in terms of client-side, server-side and mobile.

Additionally, it has a  cool feature called secret service or Spy.js, where you don’t have logs to trace, debug, and profile. The feature triggers a node.js server into running a proxy that will intercept all browser traffic and enable you to edit a JS file as you go.

## Selection for Review:
1. [Atom](https://atom.io)
2. [Brackets](https://brackets.io)

--> meeting requirements and I have not used them before

## Final Decision
For the purpose of this course I will use Visual Studio Community Edition.
[Download Visual Studio](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

After reviewing the 3 new options above with regards to interface, usability, quick code editing I felt that they did not offer enough incentive or improvement to change from the application I am used to. :smirk:

**No. 1 Reason why I chose this?**
*It is a Microsoft product with full support and the most commonly used software in companies, and I am a creature of habit and have been using this application since I first started programming.*

Positives: | Negatives:
------------ | -------------
free | large files to install
Microsoft product  | Microsoft product
most common application in workplace | can be slow at times
