            <h1>List of 'most popular' and 'best' IDEs for 2019 consolidated</h1>
            <h3>1. Atom </h3>
            Atom is an open-source cross-platform editor from Github that you can use on OS X, Windows or Linux. It
            features
            a
            built-in system that allows you to install new packages or create a custom one yourself. Developers love
            Atom
            because it’s free, customizable and because it was created using web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS,
            and
            Node.js). One of the biggest advantages of Atom is its active developer community which has created several
            plugins
            and themes.
            Atom by Github is the best editor for JavaScript if you are looking for something customizable and easy to
            use.
            It
            has a built-in package manager for installing new packages or start creating your own within this cool tool.
            Atom
            comes pre-installed with four UI and eight syntax themes in a variety of colors. The rich and supportive
            community
            also creates cool themes for everybody to use so you might find what you’re looking for there. Here are some
            of
            the
            Atom’s best features:
            - It works across different operating systems such as OS X, Windows, or Linux
            - Find, preview, and replace text as you type in a file or across all your projects.
            - Easily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple projects in one window.
            Atom is a desktop app built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js integration. It runs on Electron, a
            framework
            for building cross-platform apps using web technologies. It is definitely a web development IDE worth
            checking
            out
            if you are looking for JavaScript development tools and best HTML IDE.

            <h3>2. Brackets </h3>
            Adobe’s Brackets text editor has been around since 2014. Like Atom, Brackets is a free open-source platform
            written
            in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is used primarily for web development. Some of the features of Brackets
            include
            Inline Editors, which allow you zero-in on specific code rather than jumping between file tabs, and Live
            Preview,
            which shows you exactly what your code and changes will look like in a browser.
            Brackets is the best web IDE if you are looking for an editor that understands web design. It comes with a
            great
            set
            of visual tools and preprocessor supports and it has been created by the web designers for the web
            designers.
            Another great thing about this web development IDE is the fact that it is open source and completely free of
            charge.
            In addition to that, it has a big and passionate community which is always there to help. Here are some of
            the
            Bracket’s useful and unique features:
            Inline Editors: you can simply open a window into the code you care about most instead of jumping between
            file
            tabs.
            Live Preview: allows you to get a real-time connection to your browser; whenever you make changes to HTML
            and
            CSS,
            you immediately see the changes on the screen
            Preprocessor Support: allows you to use Quick Edit and Live Highlight with your LESS and SCSS files which
            will
            make
            working with them much easier than usually

            <h3>3. Notepad++ </h3>
            Another open-source and free editor,Notepad++ is written in C++ and offers higher speed and a smaller
            overall
            program size. Notepad has a reputation for being “environmentally friendly” and even touts this benefit on
            its
            website, highlighting the fact that it uses less CPU power resulting in a greener environment. Developers
            like
            the
            fact that Notepad++ only takes up 4MB of space upon download. It also supports 50+ programming languages and
            even
            allows users to define their own.
            Notepad++ is an opensource IDE and one of the top free IDEs written in C++. It supports over 50 languages
            and
            while
            it is not far from being the best IDE for Windows, you have to keep in mind that it is available for Windows
            only.

            <h3>4. Sublime Text </h3>
            Sublime Text is a fast and lightweight cross-platform code editor packed with features and plugins that
            developers
            love. With its “Goto Anything” keyboard shortcut, you can easily jump to any symbol or line of code within
            your
            program. The Multiple Selections option allows you to make several changes at one time rather than having to
            go
            correct each line of code individually. Built with a powerful Python API, Sublime Text welcomes several
            types of
            plugins and is completely customizable.

            <h3>5. Vim </h3>
            A free open-source software,Vim was first released way back in 1991. It is a cross-platform solution that
            continues
            to show up on favorite code editors lists decades later. Vim has a large and dedicated community of users
            that
            are
            constantly creating useful new scripts and updates to the platform. The software is completely customizable
            and
            offers extensive documentation and how-to guides for its users.

            <h3>6.Visual Studio Code x2 </h3>
            Judging by the reader feedback, VS Code is a a pretty popular code editor. It works on Windows, Mac and
            Linux
            (both
            Debian/Ubuntu and Red Hat/Fedora/SUSE). Among the advantages are an active community and a rich extension
            gallery
            that can be called by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.

            Visual Studio Code is possibly the best JavaScript ide for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Not only does it support
            JavaScript, but it also supports Node.js, TypeScript, and it comes with a whole ecosystem of extensions for
            other
            languages including C++, C#, Python, PHP etc. It provides great syntax highlighting and auto-complete with
            IntelliSense based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules. It also allows you to
            debug
            code
            by launching or attaching to your running apps debug with breakpoints, call stacks, and an interactive
            console.
            All
            in all, this IDE for JavaScript is definitely one to check out.

            <h3>7. RJ TextEd </h3>
            RJ TextEd is high on our list fighting for the spot of the best IDE for JavaScript. It is a full featured
            text
            and
            source editor with Unicode support and all in all, a great IDE for web development. It supports not only
            JavaScript,
            but also PHP, ASP, HTML, and CSS.

            <h3>8. NetBeans </h3>
            NetBeans is high on the list for the best web development IDE because it is easy to use and it lets you
            develop
            cool
            desktop, mobile, and web apps in no time. It works equally as good with JavaScript, HTML5, PHP, C/C++ etc.
            It is
            a
            free JavaScript IDE and a great HTML5 IDE for your day-to-day use. This web development IDE comes with cool
            code
            analyzing and editing tools compatible with the latest Java 8 technologies. This makes NetBeans 8.1 one of
            the
            best
            if not the best JavaScript editor. It is also a great AngularJS IDE as well as a fantastic tool for working
            with
            Node.js, Knockout.js etc. In addition to all that, it is available in a variety of languages including
            English,
            Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, and Simplified Chinese. As mentioned earlier, NetBeans supports a
            wide
            range of programming languages, but if you want the coolest web development IDE for your projects, we
            recommend
            downloading the HTML5/JavaScript built installation from the download page.

            <h3>9. SUBLIME TEXT 3 </h3>
            Sublime is a top IDE and one of the best JavaScript editors available for free. It is currently available on
            Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is fast and flexible and it will do everything one should expect from the best
            IDE
            for
            website development.

            <h3>10. IntelliJ IDEA </h3>
            IntelliJ IDEA is a great web development IDE that offers several plans. There is a free community version
            but if
            you
            want to take advantage of all the Java Script development tools it has to offer, you should consider
            checking
            out
            the paid-for Ultimate Edition. It might actually be worth your while. IntelliJ IDEA is a great CSS IDE, but
            it
            also
            supports a wide variety of programming languages such as AngularJS, CoffeeScript, HTML, JS, LESS, Node JS,
            PHP,
            Python, Ruby, Sass, TypeScript, and more. The most important features include:
            - Extensive database editor and UML designer
            - Supports multiple build systems
            - Test runner UI
            - Code coverage
            - Git integration
            - Supports Google App Engine, Grails, GWT, Hibernate, Java EE, OSGi, Play, Spring, Struts, and more
            - Deployment and debugging tools for most application servers
            - Intelligent text editors for HTML, CSS, and Java
            - Integrated version control
            - AIR Mobile supports Android and iOS devices
            However, keep in mind that while it might be the best JS editor, IntelliJ comes with a pretty steep learning
            curve so it is probably not the best option for absolute beginners.
