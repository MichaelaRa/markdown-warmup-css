    <h3>1. Atom </h3> 
    Atom is an open-source cross-platform editor from Github that you can use on OS X, Windows or Linux. It features a built-in system that allows you to install new packages or create a custom one yourself. Developers love Atom because it’s free, customizable and because it was created using web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js). One of the biggest advantages of Atom is its active developer community which has created several plugins and themes.
    Atom by Github is the best editor for JavaScript if you are looking for something customizable and easy to use. It has a built-in package manager for installing new packages or start creating your own within this cool tool. Atom comes pre-installed with four UI and eight syntax themes in a variety of colors. The rich and supportive community also creates cool themes for everybody to use so you might find what you’re looking for there. Here are some of the Atom’s best features:
    -   It works across different operating systems such as OS X, Windows, or Linux
    -   Find, preview, and replace text as you type in a file or across all your projects.
    -   Easily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple projects in one window.
    Atom is a desktop app built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js integration. It runs on Electron, a framework for building cross-platform apps using web technologies. It is definitely a web development IDE worth checking out if you are looking for JavaScript development tools and best HTML IDE.
    
    <h3>2. Brackets </h3> 
    Adobe’s Brackets text editor has been around since 2014. Like Atom, Brackets is a free open-source platform written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is used primarily for web development. Some of the features of Brackets include Inline Editors, which allow you zero-in on specific code rather than jumping between file tabs, and Live Preview, which shows you exactly what your code and changes will look like in a browser.
    Brackets is the best web IDE if you are looking for an editor that understands web design. It comes with a great set of visual tools and preprocessor supports and it has been created by the web designers for the web designers. Another great thing about this web development IDE is the fact that it is open source and completely free of charge. In addition to that, it has a big and passionate community which is always there to help. Here are some of the Bracket’s useful and unique features:
    Inline Editors: you can simply open a window into the code you care about most instead of jumping between file tabs.
    Live Preview: allows you to get a real-time connection to your browser; whenever you make changes to HTML and CSS, you immediately see the changes on the screen
    Preprocessor Support: allows you to use Quick Edit and Live Highlight with your LESS and SCSS files which will make working with them much easier than usually

    <h3>10. IntelliJ IDEA </h3> 
    IntelliJ IDEA is a great web development IDE that offers several plans.

It might actually be worth your while. IntelliJ IDEA is a great CSS IDE, but it also supports a wide variety of programming languages such as AngularJS, CoffeeScript, HTML, JS, LESS, Node JS, PHP, Python, Ruby, Sass, TypeScript, and more.
